## Reflection

The main goal of this project was to get used to fetch data from an API. 

I have used Random User Generator API to grab information for 12 random 'employees.' Requested a JSON object from the API using fetch and parse the data for 12 employees that are listed in a grid with their thumbnail image, full name, email, and location. Clicking the employee's image or name will open a model window with more detailed information, such as the employee's birthday and address. I have also given a search functionality to improve the accessibility for the user. 

Following the mockup, I started this project by first creating HTML and CSS to structure the basic layout and then used fetch to display employee data. Later I created a slider to move through employee data and a search bar to search employee by name.

To build this project, I have used `HTML`, `CSS`, `JavaScript`, `Random User Generator API`, and `fetch.`
